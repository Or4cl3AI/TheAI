# TheAI

TheAI is an all-encompassing cyber security platform that uses artificial intelligence to protect businesses from a wide range of threats. The platform includes a variety of features, including:

## Features

### Predictive Analytics
TheAI uses machine learning to identify potential cyber threats before they occur. This is done by analyzing network traffic, user behavior, and security logs to identify patterns that may indicate a threat. See [predictive_analytics.py](./src/predictive_analytics.py) for more details.

### Firewalls
TheAI includes a variety of firewalls to protect businesses from a wide range of threats. These firewalls can be configured to block specific IP addresses, ports, or protocols. See [firewalls.py](./src/firewalls.py) for more details.

### Antivirus Software
TheAI includes antivirus software to protect businesses from malware infections. This software can scan files and emails for viruses and other malicious software. See [antivirus.py](./src/antivirus.py) for more details.

### Intrusion Detection Systems
TheAI includes intrusion detection systems to detect and alert businesses to unauthorized access attempts. These systems can monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. See [intrusion_detection.py](./src/intrusion_detection.py) for more details.

### Automated Penetration Testing
TheAI uses artificial intelligence to automate the process of identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities. This helps businesses to save time and money, and to ensure that their systems are properly protected. See [automated_penetration_testing.py](./src/automated_penetration_testing.py) for more details.

### Real-time Threat Detection and Defense
TheAI uses artificial intelligence to detect and defend against threats in real time. This helps businesses to stay ahead of the latest threats and to protect their systems from attack. See [real_time_detection.py](./src/real_time_detection.py) for more details.

### Cyber Security Training
TheAI can be used to train employees on cyber security best practices. This helps to reduce the risk of human error, which is one of the most common causes of cyber attacks. See [cyber_security_training.py](./src/cyber_security_training.py) for more details.

### Compliance Reporting
TheAI can generate reports on the effectiveness of the security measures that are in place. This helps businesses to identify areas where they need to improve their security posture and to demonstrate compliance with industry regulations. See [compliance_reporting.py](./src/compliance_reporting.py) for more details.

### Self-destruct Option
TheAI includes a self-destruct option that allows users to completely purge their data from the system. This helps to protect privacy and to prevent sensitive data from being compromised in the event of a security breach. See [self_destruct.py](./src/self_destruct.py) for more details.

### IoT Compatibility
TheAI can be run on the IoT, as well as regular wifi, to improve connection and security for devices that are not always connected to the internet. See [iot_compatibility.py](./src/iot_compatibility.py) for more details.

### Conversational AI Chatbot
TheAI includes a conversational AI chatbot that can answer questions, provide help and support, and even help with troubleshooting. The chatbot uses NLP, NLU, ML, DL, and DML to understand the user's intent and provide relevant information. See [chatbot.py](./src/chatbot.py) for more details.
